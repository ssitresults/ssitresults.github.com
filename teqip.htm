            portion of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Productivity of work 
            force in the informal sector is currently low. For a balanced 
            development of the country, quality of manpower for all sectors, 
            organized as well as unorganized, needs to be improved by the 
            technical education system. TEQIP is designed to address the needs 
            of informal sector also.<br><br>
